# Configuration file for giveme version 4. This is YAML; see http://yaml.org/ for more information
# about writing YAML. It must be placed in your home directory (~) and named ".giveme4.yaml" (hidden
# file).
#
# All you need to do to add a tool is copy format used below, changing just the extension ('mp3',
# 'wav', etc) and the exePath and args values appropriately for the tool.
#
# For the tools already listed below, you may need to adjust their exePaths to the right paths on
# your system (if you want to use them).
mp3:
    encode:
        exePath: /usr/local/bin/lame
        args: -V0 --quiet $INFILE $OUTFILE
    decode:
        exePath: /usr/local/bin/lame
        args: --decode --quiet $INFILE $OUTFILE


flac:
    encode:
        exePath: /usr/local/bin/flac
        args: -V -8 --silent -o $OUTFILE $INFILE
    decode:
        exePath: /usr/local/bin/flac
        args: --decode -s -o $OUTFILE $INFILE

# DO NOT REMOVE THIS TOOL
# special case: we just need to move wav files around on disk so they work as sources or destinations
# for other tools. if this "tool" is not present, giveme simply won't work. It remains here in case
# users need to adjust where `cp' is on their system.
wav:
    encode:
        exePath: /bin/cp
        args: $INFILE $OUTFILE
    decode:
        exePath: /bin/cp
        args: $INFILE $OUTFILE
